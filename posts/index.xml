Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a way of searching for information on only publicly available sources (open source). While this may seem to be the same way everyone searches for information, there are many tools and methodologies that can be used to enhance your research capabilities.</description>

Untrusted data/code should live in a process with almost zero permissions Spawn &amp;ldquo;privileged&amp;rdquo; parent process Spawn &amp;ldquo;sandboxed&amp;rdquo; child processes When a child needs to perform a privileged action, it asks the parent chroot What is chroot (change-root): used to be the de-facto sandboxing utility changes the meaning of &amp;ldquo;/&amp;rdquo; for a process (and its children) chroot(&amp;quot;/tmp/jail&amp;quot;) will disallow processes from getting out of the jail no syscall filtering or other isolation chroot() does NOT: Close resources that reside outside of the jail cd (chdir()) into the jail Do anything else!</description>

In module 2 there wasn&amp;rsquo;t as much content to cover so this post isn&amp;rsquo;t too long. I&amp;rsquo;d still reccomend checking out the lectures yourself for demonstrations on each of the topics covered.

        <description>As a part of my degree program, I have to take a class called CSE466: Computer Systems Security. The professor for this class (Dr. Shoshitaishvili) created pwn.college, a free education platform to guide not only students in the course, but anyone who wants to try it out. I will be publishing all of my notes from each relevant module of course here, though I highly recommend watching the lectures for yourself as they go much more in-depth!</description>

        <title>Making Regex Rules in Semgrep</title>

        <description>One feature of Semgrep is the ability to use regular expressions (regex) in your rule making. In the previous post we discussed what Semgrep is and how to use it, here we will be focusing specifically on how to use Semgrep in conjunction with regex as it can get complicated
Setup Make sure you have a good understanding of how to use Semgrep, especially with creating your own custom YAML rules</description>

        <description>The goal of this post is to give an introduction into how to create rules using Semgrep as well as getting a broad overview of what the tool is. The structure here will be to first explore the tool, then go into examples on how to use it with the User Interface(UI) to understand the logic, then finally go into how to actually code the rules on a more complex level.</description>

Penetration testing is defined as the process of assessing the security model of an organization. When we perform a pentest, we want to make sure we not only do proper research, but also ensure that we are conducting the pentest properly and within the bounds of the client&amp;rsquo;s needs, as well as making sure to protect ourselves in the process.</description>

        <description> There are hundreds of websites out there with useful information and helpful tools that can be used while hacking, so I decided to create a list of helpful websites for different aspects of hacking as I come along them. I will make sure to update this list as I come across more, so make sure to check back regularly!
Information Gathering DNS Reconnaissance DNSDumpster: will provide a visual breakdown of where/what a domain&amp;rsquo;s servers/hosts are located, as well as maps the domain in relation to its hosts/servers Hunter: insert a domain and it will return known email addresses connected to the website (you do have to make an account but it is free) ViewDNS: site that allows you to run a variety of tests against domains, IPs, and email addresses such as Whois, IP History, Location Finder, and more Whoxy: performs Whois and Reverse Whois lookups, as well as searches for owners, emails, and more (search tool is at the top right of the website, you can ignore the paid options advertised) Active Reconnaissance Exploit Database: hopefully you know this one already, but use this to find common vulnerability exploits (CVE) and how to replicate them Website Pentesting HTTP Status Codes: a simple site that lists all possible HTTP status codes along with what they mean and some specific information you can interpret from them Decrypting/Password Attacks CyberChef: a GitHub project that allows you to use encryption/decryption tools against any given text Weak Passwords: website that gives you the current top 50 most common passwords in use Privilege Escalation Super helpful blog post that walks you through how to do enumeration on a new host with the intention of privilege escalation Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet: cheat sheet that provides the code for how to deploy a reverse shell and the process in different languages Reporting Carbon: nice site that allows you to paste your code and edit it to make it look more readable for reports </description>

There are two main ways in which you can set up Kali Linux, you can either create a Virtual Machine (VM) and install the Kali Operating System (OS), or you can Single/Dual Boot your computer to have Kali (both of which are 100% free).</description>

        <description>In a new terminal window, run nmap -sV -O -F --version-light 10.10.10.3 Another option is to open Zenmap and run a port scan on the same IP (to see just the information on the ports, you can go to the Ports/Hosts tab) Zenmap is a program that does a really good job at visualizing and breaking down nmap commands into digestible bites Now there a a LOT of different ways to use nmap, and being that I&amp;rsquo;m still learning you are going to be seeing a lot of different versions, but I will do my best to explain what each version does.</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome to my walkthroughs for Hack the Box (HTB). I&amp;rsquo;ve challenged myself with completing 50 HTB machines to learn hacking tools and skills that will prepare me for a career in the field. Being that I am a beginner at the time of writing this, I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to solve any machine without guidance at first, so my plan is as follows:
The first 10 machines I will do with the help of other write-ups and tutorials (I will attach links to any resources I use at the bottom of each of my walkthroughs).</description>
